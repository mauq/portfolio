  "about": "I'm Quinn. I'm currently a senior at the University of Washington studying Human Centered Design & Engineering and Quantitative Science. I'm currently seeking an entry level position/internship in experience and interface design, data science, or software development. While most of my expertise lies in programming, namely front-end web development and software development, I am incredibly intrigued by data, statistics, and the intersection of data, statistics, and programming.<br></br> I'm interested in working towards a cause I support like conserving and restoring the environment or protecting the wellbeing of those in need. I believe my technical background and interest in my work gives me a competitive edge in all my endeavors in and out of the workplace.<br></br> If you're interested in learning more, feel free to shoot me an email at the address below or connect with me on LinkedIn!",
