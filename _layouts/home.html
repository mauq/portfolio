            <p>Hi, I'm Quinn. I am currently finishing up my senior year at the University of Washington with a degree in Human Centered Design &amp; Engineering. While most of my coursework and job experience has gone towards UX design and front-end web development, I have decided to change directions and work towards becoming a data scientist. I have a passion for data, mathematics, and graphics &mdash; and to me, data science is the perfect intersection of the three. Outside of work, I love to fly fish, rock climb and mountain climb, and make music.</p>

            <p>Please have a look around my portfolio and don't forget to check out my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/blog">blog</a> where I'll be documenting my journey of becoming a data scientist! If anything strikes your interest and you want to talk, please feel free to contact me!</p>
