# Hello,
Welcome to my first blog post!

In this blog post, I'll attempt to explain who I am, what is going on here, and what I am trying to accomplish by writing these blog posts. At the end I'll walk through what I already know and some of the plans I have.

Let's start with who I am. I am Quinn Mau. I am currently finishing up my time as an undergraduate at the University of Washington with a degree in Human Centered Design & Engineering. While most of my experience and coursework falls under the UX and web development umbrella, I have always been excited by data, math and statistics, and data visualization, and I have recently decided to pursue a career in data science. There is something about combining huge conglomerates of information, programming, and statistical knowledge to learn more on a particular subject that truly excites me! Outside of school, I enjoy making music and being outside. I recently picked up fly fishing and you could say I'm hooked (cue laughter). I play in a band called Leche (we play local shows in Seattle and neighboring towns).

Enough about me. What is going on here?

I am using this blog as a memoir of my journey to becoming a data scientist! As often as I can, I will be making posts about what I am currently learning or updates on whatever project I am working on at the time. Why you may ask? For me at least, explaining a concept I am learning forces me to really understand it. So this blog is really serving to fully understand what I am learning. Additionally, this blog will allows other to catch a glimpse of how I think, and who knows, maybe the readers will learn a thing or two along the way.

My current plan as it stands right now is to continue reading Introduction to Statistical Learning doing all the labs and questions, then start to apply what I have learned by entering a few [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) competitions as well as try to put together a personal project or two from scratch. I'm talking creating my own datasets and everything!

I already have experience programming in python as well as R, and I have read a couple chapters of ISLR already (which I will make posts about later) but I still have a lot to learn. I'm excited to share more and hope I get some more posts done soon!

Cheers!
